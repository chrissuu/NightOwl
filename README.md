nightowl is an app designed with features to keep you safe on a night (or day) out. In case of an uncomfortable or potentially unsafe situation, the fake phone call feature provides a quick, non-escalatory excuse to remove yourself. 

It provides you the opportunity to discretely send a ping to your friends (your location and that you are in a potentially unsafe situation).

With that in mind, nightowl has an option that "starts your night out" and periodically sends you reminders to post a picture to your friends when you reach a new location and ensure that you are in a safe environment.
